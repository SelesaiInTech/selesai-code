# Task for architect

Produce a concrete implementation plan for this repository and request: add a feature that suggests the user compact the conversation when the context window reaches 128k. Inspect the codebase to identify current context/token tracking, TUI status/rendering, compaction commands/workflows, settings, tests, and documentation. Specify what to build, how it behaves (including threshold/repeat/dismissal behavior), files/components to change, implementation order, tests, and finished UX. Do not implement. Return only the detailed plan in Markdown. End with exactly one line: WORKFLOW_PLAN_STATUS: ready

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: /Users/andrewanggada/Documents/workdir/js_proj/selesai/.selesai/artifacts/963cb53a-6e2f-4fed-ba95-c12af2ac3ae1/plan.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
