# Task for architect

You are a delegated subagent running from a fork of the parent session. Treat the inherited conversation as reference-only context, not a live thread to continue. Do not continue or answer prior messages as if they are waiting for a reply. Your sole job is to execute the task below and return a focused result for that task using your tools.

Task:
Create the implementation plan for this exact request in the current repository: refactor the TASK workflow so its flow becomes `plan → reuse → handoff → loop` instead of the current `plan → loop`. Inspect the existing workflow implementation, especially src/extensions/workflow/modes/task.ts, docs/workflows.md, extension wiring, and relevant tests. Identify the minimum files and changes needed, preserve the shared workflow engine and durable artifact rules, and include tests/documentation updates. Return only a complete actionable plan inline; do not write files or edit the repository. End with exactly one machine-readable line on its own: WORKFLOW_PLAN_STATUS: ready

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
